    FILAMENT DETECTION USING REGION GROWING (06/03/2003)


  1.Image cleaning (limb fitting,...) 

  2.Correct the luminosity across the image.
    -An average background of the image is obtained by applying a
     two-dimensional median filter with a width of 30. The resulting
     image is then subtracted to the original (or divided).

  3.Cleaning of dust pixels (and darkest lines removal).
    -The image is convolved by a 3x3 filter with all values set to 1
     except the center value which is set to 0 in order that the
     values are replaced by the mean of their neighbourhood.
    -The resulting image is divided by the original one so that the
     dust pixels can be located by a treshold (p < 1-1/8 or p > 1+1/8).
    -The pixels previously determined shouldn't be part of any
     candidate filament. To avoid that, a lowest value is computed
     from the mean and standard deviaton of the image and the
     neighbourhood values of the candidate pixel are checked. If more
     than 3/4 of them are below the treshold then the pixel is
     considered to be part of a dark region which may be a filament.
    -If not, the dust pixel value and it's 8-neighbourhood are replaced
     by the median of a larger neighbourhood.

  4.Seed points.
    -A global treshold is computed from the image statistics:
     T = mean - 3*standard dev. 
    -The seed points could be found by tresholding the image with this
     value, but in some cases the image is composed with regions showing
     very different gradient, leading to many false seed detection.
    -To deal with that, the morphological gradient of the contrast
     enhanced image is computed and smoothed with a large median
     filter (width=80). The final treshold is defined by a linear
     combination of the global treshold and of the resulting image:
     Tfinal = TGlobal - alpha*(result - mean(result)) 
    -If the original image doesn't show this discontinuity it will
     almost not affect the treshold.

  5.Region growing
    -An ellipse is fitted to every seed region previously found. From
     the major axis length, a neighbourhood of the seed is defined. 
    -The statistics of the region give the maximum value 
     for the region growing function:max=mean(region)-1.4*stdev(region)
     The minimum is the seed's minimum value.
    -The final region size is checked and discarded if lower than 20
     pixels.
    -Before labeling a morphological closing operation is computed
     to link up close blobs.

  Note:

    -The sunspots are also detected and a morphological discrimination 
     is not enough to remove them, although some are discared by the
     size criteria
    -The region growing function can also be applied to the original 
     image (instead of enhanced contrast one). The comparison with
     Meudon synoptic maps may settle the question.
    -The stripes across the image which are not removed lead to false
     detection
